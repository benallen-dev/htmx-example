## How to run

```sh
$ go run server.go
```

Then go to `localhost:1323` in your browser and leave React behind forever.

Simple.css was the first no-class drop-in stylesheet I found and it looks pretty good. Who needs tailwind if semantic HTML looks good?

Actually I really like Tailwind but I don't really want a javascript build step at this point.
